# MPBA
Two Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files for analyzing the MPBA data: one for the wild-type experiment and second for the delta 12 TFs experiment.
One may produce the plots of figures 1-2 and of supp. figures 1-7 by running those files.

In addition, two zipped directories are shared - one with the data of the MPBA WT experiment and second with the data of the MPBA delta 12 TFs experiment. One should retain the original structure of the directories, and run the corresponding .ipynb files accordingly. Inside the files, one should specify in the dedicated locations the paths of the directories for successful code running.
